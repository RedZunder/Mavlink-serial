# Mavlink-serial
Interface in C for Mavlink based on STM32


## Concept
The idea is to design an interface where the user can read information from and send data to a drone, using STM32 as the brains and the ELRS Micro TX as the sender/receiver module.

Using the [Mavlink v2 library for C](https://mavlink.io/en/mavgen_c/).
